# MC303-Dev Introduction
This repository is designed by JSemos, a former lecturer in the Mathematics & Computer Science department, and a web developer with industry experience. These 2022 assessments aim to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application, while the solutions serve as a portfolio of developer work.

# Assessment Objectives
Evaluate students' understanding of programming fundamentals.
Assess problem-solving skills and logical thinking.
Encourage the application of theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.
Provide feedback to help students improve their coding skills.

# Prerequisites
Before starting the assessment, ensure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts (variables, loops, functions, etc.).
- Familiarity with [Programming Language] (e.g., Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, JS).

2. Create a new branch with your name (e.g., feature/john-doe).
3. Implement your solution in the solution directory.
4. Commit your changes and push the branch to your forked repository.
5. Create a pull request to the main repository with your solution.

Portfolio Submission: After your pull request is merged, you can include the link to your solution file in your portfolio to showcase your work.

Grading Criteria
Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Correctness: Does the solution produce the correct output for all test cases?
- Efficiency: Is the solution optimized for performance?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, readable, and follows best practices?
